<H3>A case study in using R to facilitate statistical and non-statistical interdepartmental collaboration

Welcome to A New Hope - an introductory case study in beginning theoretical applications of using R and RStudio.  For
more information on R and RStudio, please review the https://rstudio.com. The following is a hypothetical, fictionalized
accounting of a real-world collaboration within one technology company.

<b>Context:</b> In December 2018, PHP versions 5.6 and 7.0 both reached their respective EOL timeframe. As a result,
these versions would no longer be supported by the PHP Community, thus no more patches to these Apache versions, leaving
servers potentially vulnerable to new security threats that arise after the support cycle completed.

<b>Platform Hosting Outer Rim Commerce Enterprises, Inc. (PHORCE)</b> (formerly branded as the Trade Federation) is now
tasked with upgrading their entire server farm that supports 10 planets and mobile stations within the Galactic Empire
within a six month timeline.  This necessitates collaboration from the <b>Operations Data Team (ODT)</b>, the <b>Imperial
Consortium for Engineering (ICE)</b>, and the <b>Coruscant Communications Network (CCN)</b> to personally communicate with
each of their customers to plan and execute the upgrade plan.

<b>Purpose of Case Study</b>:
- Demonstrate how to efficiently use a single dataset to collaborate between multiple departments with different data
requirements
- Demonstrate how to reduce amount of code needed by using replicable functions and simple for loops
- Provide self practice opportunity for creating a fictional case study and build an RMarkdown report highlighting results
